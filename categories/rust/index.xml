      <description>How to run Rust on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense? - DRAFT things I want to write about:
 Arduino 33 BLE Sense - what&amp;rsquo;s it good for, why did I get one? Why would I want to use Rust with it, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with Arduino code? How to make a bootloader? How to get Arduino connected to J-Link/BMP?  Here&amp;rsquo;s my BLESense after attaching the SWD wires, happily blinking the blue LED.</description>

      <description>My embedded experiments This is yet another test of what I would like to show here. I want to talk about tinkering with embedded devices in Rust. Why embedded, and why Rust? Because:
 it&amp;rsquo;s cool I like it I&amp;rsquo;m learning new things!  So in embedded Rust, you start with something like this:
#[no_main] #[no_std] use panic_halt as _; fn main() -&amp;gt; ! { let mut x: u8 = 42; println!</description>

      <description>The tradition must continue, therefore the first post shall be the &amp;ldquo;Hello, world!&amp;rdquo;
This is not really the first post, though: I backdated it by a few days to make it so.
It is still a work in progress project, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really matter that much, I suppose.
And here&amp;rsquo;s the code, in two different versions:
Python print(&amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34;) Rust fn main () { println!(&amp;#34;Hello, world!&amp;#34;); } Nice code&amp;hellip; formatting!</description>
