      <description>How to run Rust on Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense? - DRAFT things I want to write about:
 Arduino 33 BLE Sense - what&amp;rsquo;s it good for, why did I get one? Why would I want to use Rust with it, what&amp;rsquo;s wrong with Arduino code? How to make a bootloader? How to get Arduino connected to J-Link/BMP? How to flash the bootloader? What to do later:  memory.x and SoftDevice target definition nRF-HAL simple blinkenlight   How to get the sensors to work?</description>

      <description>My embedded experiments This is yet another test of what I would like to show here. I want to talk about tinkering with embedded devices in Rust. Why embedded, and why Rust? Because:
 it&amp;rsquo;s cool I like it I&amp;rsquo;m learning new things!  So in embedded Rust, you start with something like this:
#[no_main] #[no_std] use panic_halt as _; And after you add some more code to initialize various element of the microcontroller and such, you can see something like this:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Michał, a.k.a. Nebelgrau. Self-described as an &amp;ldquo;aspiring data witcher, wannabe embedded Rustacean, Pythonista and TinyML afficionado&amp;rdquo; :)
Let me unpack all that!
Somewhere towards the end of 2017 I decided to learn something about data science, so I found out about Python and started with that. I was curious about electronics, and thought this would help me learn programming in general, so I also started tinkering with MicroPython on Espressif and STM32 devices.</description>
